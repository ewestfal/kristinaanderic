<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>Your RSVP has now been completed.  Please browse <html:link href="http://www.kristinaanderic.com">the rest of the site</html:link> to find out more information about the wedding.  Our wedding will be taking place on the same weekend as Indiana University's homecoming.  This means the area may be a little bit busier than it normally is.  Since the church is downtown, parking may also be an issue.  Please see the <a href="../parking.jsp">parking</a> page for more detaisls.  If you have any questions or comments you can email us at <html:link href="mailto:ewestfal@gmail.com">ewestfal@gmail.com</html:link>  You can come back to this site at a later date and change your RSVP if you need to as long as you do so before October 13.  Thanks again!</p>
