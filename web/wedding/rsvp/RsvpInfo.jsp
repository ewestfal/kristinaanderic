<h3>RSVP Info</h3>
<p>If, for some reason, you are having trouble with the RSVP web application, we have provided a couple of alternate methods of responding.</p>
<p>The first option is to email us your RSVP at ewestfal@gmail.com  Include in this email:
  <ul>
    <li>Your Phone Number</li>
    <li>Indicate whether your party will be attending or not.</li>
    <li>The names of the people in your party who will be attending.</li>
    <li>The meal choices of the people in your party.  The options are: chicken, pasta, or child.
  </ul>
</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you cannot email us, then the second option is to leave your RSVP over the phone.  Our phone number is 812-320-2722.  This should send you to a voice mail message with instructions on how to leave your RSVP.  The information needed is basically the same as the information needed for RSVPing via email.
</p>
<p>Remember, RSVPs must be received no later than October 13, 2004.  Thank you for responding and we hope you enjoy the wedding!</p>
