<h3>Parking</h3>
<p>The church at which the ceremony is taking place is in downtown Bloomington.  Also, our wedding is the same weekend as IU's homecoming!  Those who know this area know that finding a parking spot can be difficult at times.  The wedding coordinator at the church has assured us that the parking situation always seems to work out and everyone can find a spot.  I'm hoping this will be the case on our wedding day as well :)  At any rate, we suggest that guests arrive early in order to find a parking spot.  There are many parking spots along the various roads downtown.  If all else fails, there is a parking garage at 4th and Walnut which should (hopefully) still be free on the weekends by the time our wedding day rolls around.  Of course, if you have any questions about this you can always <a href="contactus.jsp">contact us</a>.
