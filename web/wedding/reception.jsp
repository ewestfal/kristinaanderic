<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?

">Mapquest link</a> where you can enter an address and get precise directions to Terry's.  Unfortunately, because of the nature of mapquest, there is no easy way for me to link directly to directions from the church to the reception hall.  Therefore, you must enter the church address manually if you want those directions.  The address of the church is 205 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN, 47408.
