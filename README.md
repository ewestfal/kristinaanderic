This is the old project I built to create the website for Kristina and my wedding back on October 30, 2004.

The website was http://www.kristinaanderic.come

I think it was hosted at http://www.kgbinternet.com/ which somehow still appears to be a company (though their website looks straight out of the 90's).

At any rate, it was a simple website where people could come and RSVP for the wedding. And it worked! We did almost all of our RSVP's through there.

I thought I would post the code up to GitHub just for fun. Unfortunately, this code used so many bad practices
and passwords were strewn everywhere throughout files and even in source code. So I went through and redacted
all of those.
